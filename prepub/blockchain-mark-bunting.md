As an advisor and investor to several technology firms, I like to keep a close eye on emerging trends. I am acutely aware of the ongoing transformation in energy. In this category, I am actively involved with Logicor, ..... etc.

In this guest post, I share my observations about the blockchain investment landscape and its potential as a competitive weapon in smart energy.

### Thoughts on Blockchain’s emergence
Changes in the FinTech sector are clearly being fuelled by blockchain. I first become aware of this in ..... through ...... Whilst many believe that the advancements taking place are going to be game changing, I have a more guarded perspective.

From [Blockchain Adoption in Capital Markets - 2018](https://www.greenwich.com/equities/blockchain-adoption-capital-markets-2018) by financial market intelligence firm [Greenwich Associates][48] I see that reduced operating costs is a primary benefit of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. The total annual budget for enterprise blockchain initiatives across capital markets and banking are a staggering $1.7B!

Some use cases for blockchain in banking and other financial institutions map to the energy sector. Think renewables project financing and commodity trading. However, its role in the energy sector operations and energy retailing is more nuanced.

### Evaluating investment opportunities in the energy sector
>Building upon my experience, I’ve shifted nearly all of our investments into Blockchain.  When sizing up an investment I look at factors like the quality of the development team and who else is behind the project.  I also like to know whether their leaders have some prior experience in tech. And longevity is important. If they’ve existed for 2-3 years, that speaks volumes. **(Steven Nerayoff)[SN]**

### Raising the Likelihood of Startup Success
>I look closely at who their CTO is. The blockchain application platform Lisk is a great example. Their CTO Olivier Beddows is at the right age and has really good background and experience.  

>For me, the operative question is whether that person can truly lead a technology team. I’ve personally had startups with a CTO, a Chief of Engineering and hundreds of programmers underneath me. So I understand how complex these platforms are to build and how difficult it is to stay on target with project timelines. I also look to see whether they are solving a pain point that’s optimal for the blockchain to solve. I assess whether they can solve it in a way that is will eventually catch on with the masses. **(Steven Nerayoff)[SN]**

### How to Navigate the Competitive Landscape
Having first mover advantage is helpful but is neither necessary nor sufficient.

> We’re already seeing this with Monera, Dash and eventually Zcash in the private transaction niche. **(Steven Nerayoff)[SN]**

> All of this begs the question “who is going to ultimately make it?” And more importantly, can they extend beyond themselves in order to achieve momentum. Take Zcash for example. I believe they possess the unique ability to extend beyond its own currency. In other words, Zcash could be embedded into other currencies, other systems, other protocols. Another example is Lisk. What I like about them is their ability to easily port over applications like those built for Ethereum onto the Lisk platform. They are making moves that I believe will be very impactful. **(Steven Nerayoff)[SN]**

### Key Value Propositions
Blockchain's most important feature is [immutability](https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/02/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-immutability-of-blockchains/). It is important to note that immutability does not mean that the data can’t be changed. Rather it is very difficult to change without collusion it is easy to detect attempt.

This is particularly valuable in applications it’s critical that transactions are part of a permanent record. For example ....

### Ones to Watch
I am particularly intrigued by [Electron](http://www.electron.org.uk) and am delighted that they will be at the NovAzure and Tilix Masterclass.

I am keeping a close eye on [R3](https://www.r3.com), waiting to see when they may be ready to engage properly with the energy sector.

The [Zero Carbon Project][ZCP1] is another with exciting prospects. They are tackling climate change using blockchain and recently [won two blockchain awards in London and Amsterdam][ZCP2]. [Zero Carbon Project is currently in the democratic private pre-sale round][ZCP3].

### Final Thoughts
I believe blockchain will touch every element of the energy value chain in one way or another. The rationale is simple: the sector is moving from a static, linear structure of large generators -> monopoly networks -> disengaged consumer to a complex web of distributed, smart and clean system including a large number of engaged prosumers.

For many blockchain is a space for prospectors. For example, traditional investors with their rational thinking would not invest in Ethereum a couple of years ago. It now has an eye-watering market cap! I see that blockchain is crossing the chasm from the world of prospectors to that of the investor. I am doing my homework and getting ready to make investments in the next year or two.
