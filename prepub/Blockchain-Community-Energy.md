At first glance you might be forgiven for wondering why several recent pilot peer-to-peer/local renewable energy schemes, such as EDF’s London-based community energy scheme, have been highlighting the use of blockchain as part of their model. After all isn’t blockchain a massive energy user, a ponzi scheme and frequently associated with extremist politics, none of which are things generally endorsed by responsible and socially aware business ventures. Added to that, those of you in business will have been aware of the recent trend where blockchain is touted (either by pointy-haired bosses or enthusiastic consultants) as a panacea to all of your ills, to the extent that a US Iced Tea company saw an overnight 289% stock price jump after rebranding to include the word ‘blockchain’ in their name. Some of you might see this as signs of, at the least, an example of a peak of inflated expectation and at worst the beginning of the end for society as we know it, but there are valid reasons why the underlying technology could help drive forward a radical new model of energy generation and consumption.

> [For the rest of this piece I am going to assume that you are broadly au fait with the fundamentals of blockchain, but if you need a quick refresher then this will give you the basics.]

Earlier this year, IBM published a think-piece which detailed the criteria that should be considered when deciding whether your idea could benefit from incorporating blockchain technology into the design, with the core concept being:

Is a business network involved? If so, are one or more of the following also true?
1. Is consensus used to validate transactions?
2. Is an audit trail, or provenance, required?
3. Must the record of transactions be immutable, or tamper proof?
4. Should dispute resolution be final?

If these criteria can be met, then there is a good, rational, case to be made to investigate how blockchain might help your project. In the case of a local energy proposal then yes, there is a business network involved (generators and consumers) AND at the very least points 2, 3 and 4 are necessary to ensure integrity and validity of transactions. Consensus validation would help prevent 51% attacks, but these could be easily prevented in a small-scale community scheme through specific, secure hardware (tamper-proof low power mining systems for processing the transactions), or constrained entry criteria (domestic users only, no industrial scale usage or generation).

>[I think there is another long-ish paragraph which needs to fit in here, but I haven’t quite worked out what it is yet. Probably a broad-brush description of how we see our approach working, but without specifics. If nothing else that will invite potentially useful criticism of the model in the comments?]

A model such as this would also be able to demonstrably address at least two of the concerns about blockchain that I listed at the beginning, as the blockchain processing would, by definition, be powered by (and drive uptake of) renewable energy and the tokens themselves would be backed by the electricity generated as a valid and securitisable, if intangible, asset.

The politics, regrettably, I cannot help with.
