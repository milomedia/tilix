title: "Reading Meters"
---
Most energy retailers have a "How to read your meter" webpage and I have enjoyed comparing the content from a selection of retail energy supply firms. It is clear that there are challenges around informing customers about such a technical subject. I also notice that the style and quality varies considerably according to the tone of voice, style, priorities and maturity of the retail business.

## The Analysis
From search engine results, "how to read your meter" publishers fall into the following groups:

1. Organisations providing general information to consumers.
2. Government & Regulatory
3. Commercial participants in the energy market

### General Sources of Information
For UK consumers, Citizens Advice provide very good content about energy metering. For example, [How to read your energy meter][CAB] is very well presented and easy to follow. It does claim that the "advice applies to England". This is interesting because Ofgem's licensing applies in Scotland and Wales too!

Of course Wikipedia offers some great content (e.g. [Electricity Meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_meter). However, this is encyclopaedic and will probably overwhelm most consumers. WikiHow provides high quality user generator content (e.g. [How to Read an Electric Meter][wikiHow]. It is a good read despite the adverts getting in the way.

Videos also appear in the search engines results. A fine example being from [SarBar Multimedia](https://youtu.be/BwbccKj9vVI). However, I am focussed on the written word, so I will say no more about videos.

### Government & Regulatory
Ofgem's publishes lots of content on metering (e.g. [Meter reading and installation][ofgem]). Whilst useful for energy industry professionals, it does not contain much of value for the average consumer. I also wonder why Ofgem don't have a page on electric equivalent of their gas meter reading and installation page.

In-depth, technical information about metering can be found at The Office for Product Safety and Standards. One of its goals this government office is to enhance protections for consumers. However, I think its content on metering (e.g. [Gas meter readings and bill calculation - GOV.UK][gov2]) is not targeted at the general consumer audience.

### Commercial participants in the energy market
[Orbit Energy](https://orbitenergy.co.uk/meters) have a fantastic page about how to read your meter, how to read different types of meters, an with a selection of imagery to go with it. It was very informative. I really liked the style of this one and felt it was  written clearly enough for everyone to understand.

[Ovo Energy](https://www.ovoenergy.com/help/meter-readings#how-do-i-read-my-meter) ....

The advice from [Octopus](https://octopus.energy/help-and-faqs/categories/meters/how-do-i-read-my-meter/) on reading meters was hard to find for a customer who isn’t energy savvy. It was under the ‘Help and FAQs’ section, but would have been easier to access if it was in a category of its own. It only detailed six questions.

[Bulb](https://help.bulb.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/115001232832-How-do-I-read-my-meter-) don't include meter reading in their navigation, but their advice was easy to find using the search function within their help section.

## Smart Metering
Smart metering is a hot topic in the UK energy industry just now. The promise is to make "manual meter reading" for domestic consumers a thing of the past. Some of the most fervent content comes from [Smart Energy GB](https://www.smartenergygb.org/en) whose mission is:

> to give everyone the enthusiasm and confidence to say "yes" to smart meters. We’ll make sure everyone knows how they can use their smart meter and understands the benefits.

The [Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy][gov] and [Energy UK][energyUK] have published a lot of information on smart meters. However, this is quite formal and more for a professional audience.

Despite the best intentions of smart metering, some domestic consumers may need to take manual meter reads like those described in this post may for a few more years. Also, consumers with smart meters will be faced with a whole host of new usability and trust challenges e.g.

- Verifying that the automated meter reads as accurate
- Protecting the privacy of the personal data collected
- Not adding radio interference that that will affect the smart meter.
- Getting to grips with the in home display.

## Conclusions
Having a "how to read your meter" page is vital in all energy suppliers because inaccurate or missing readings are very expensive.

- treat gas and electricity seperately....

- use images to clearly illustrate the difference between each meter; for example, a single rate meter and a double rate meter.

Visual stimuli to support any statement you make when writing a page like this is vital for any customer to fully understand what reading a meter shows through a visual example.

It is also important after all of these explanations of how to read your meter, to feature an image that has numbers on. This way, a customer will be able to identify visually which meter is theirs, and not give an incorrect reading to their energy company. For example, in the image above, you would state, "Your reading here is *****".

So there you have it. The last extra information I would also recommend giving, would be - if online - a link to the FAQs page, details about perhaps where their electric meter is stored if they can't find it, and details of how to contact customer services if the customer is really in need of some help or stuck not being able to read or identify their meter. It might seem tedious, but remember, there are customers out there who have never made a meter reading before.

Being able to understand how a meter works and being able to read it is a real difficulty for many people, and if having a page explaining how meters work makes this easier, I believe it is a necessity for a retail supplier to feature something like this.

On the back of this research, I wrote a couple of "how to read your meter" pages. The first was a training exercise and the "client" was the fictional ACME Energy. Having creative freedom here was a double edge sword. The second piece was for Logicor Energy. This provided me with less creative freedom but it was comforting to have the structure of existing content to work around.
