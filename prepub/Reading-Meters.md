As part of my training in the energy supply sector, I was given a brief to write a useful, usable and credible meter reading page for ACME Energy (a fictional electricity supplier).

This assignment helped me understand the challenges around informing customers about a quite technical subject. I also enjoyed comparing the content styles of a selection of retail energy supply firms.

## The Analysis
The first part of the job was to discover and review content available online. From search engine results, I could arrange the content publishers into two groups:

1. Web pages from organisations providing general information.
2. Energy retailers etc who as well as providing customer service are use this content to as part of their marketing mix.

### General Sources of Information
For UK consumers, Citizens Advice provide very good content about energy metering. For example, [How to read your energy meter][CAB] is very well presented and easy to follow. It does claim that the "advice applies to England". Which made me wonder what is different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?

Ofgem's publishes lots of content on metering (e.g. [Meter reading and installation][ofgem]). Whilst useful for me, I don't think it contains much of value for the average consumer. I also wonder why Ofgem don't have a page on electric equivalent of their gas meter reading and installation page.

More in-depth information about metering can be found at The Office for Product Safety and Standards. One of its goals is to enhance protections for consumers. However, I think its content on metering (e.g. [Gas meter readings and bill calculation - GOV.UK][gov2]) is not targeted at the general consumer audience.

Of course Wikipedia offers some great content (e.g. [Electricity Meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_meter). However, this is encyclopaedic and will probably overwhelm most consumers. WikiHow provides high quality user generator content (e.g. [How to Read an Electric Meter][wikiHow]. It is a good read, even if the adverts get in the way.

Videos also appear in the search engines results. A fine example being from [SarBar Multimedia](https://youtu.be/BwbccKj9vVI). However, my brief is to write copy, so I am ignoring videos for now.

Smart is the hot topic in metering and promises to make "manual meter reading" for domestic consumers a thing of the past. Some of the most fervent content comes from [Smart Energy GB](https://www.smartenergygb.org/en) whose mission is:

> to give everyone the enthusiasm and confidence to say "yes" to smart meters. We’ll make sure everyone knows how they can use their smart meter and understands the benefits.

The [Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy][gov] and [Energy UK][energyUK] have published a lot of information on smart meters. However, this is quite formal and more for a professional audience.

Despite the best intentions of smart metering, some domestic consumers may need to take manual meter reads like those described in this post may for a few more years. Also, consumers with smart meters will be faced with a whole host of new usability and trust challenges e.g.

- Verifying that the automated meter reads as accurate
- Protecting the privacy of the personal data collected
- Not adding radio interference that that will affect the smart meter.
- Getting to grips with the in home display.

### Examples from Suppliers & TPIs
[Orbit Energy](https://orbitenergy.co.uk/meters) have a fantastic page about how to read your meter, how to read different types of meters, an with a selection of imagery to go with it. It was very informative. Really liked the style of this one, it was really written for everyone to understand.

[Ovo Energy](https://www.ovoenergy.com/help/meter-readings#how-do-i-read-my-meter) have a page for smart meters, and explained what they were, how many they had installed, why they were better etc. Then it stated how to get one, and the steps through this. At the end it had a few FAQs about meters and how to switch to a smart meter.

The advice from [Octopus](https://octopus.energy/help-and-faqs/categories/meters/how-do-i-read-my-meter/) on reading meters was hard to find for a customer who isn’t energy savvy. It was under the ‘Help and FAQs’ section, but would have been easier to access if it was in a category of its own. It only detailed six questions.

[Bulb](https://help.bulb.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/115001232832-How-do-I-read-my-meter-) don't include meter reading in their navigation, but their advice was easy to find using the search function within their help section.

## ACME Energy
Armed with the results of my research, I was ready to write my own guide to meter reading for the fictional firm ACME Energy.

To make things simple, the brief was:

- Domestic electricity supply only
- Ignore Smart Metering.

### Single Rate Meter
Write down the first five numbers from left to right, but ignore the red one.

### Double Rate Meter
Write down the first five numbers from left to right on the top row, and then write down the five numbers from left to right on the bottom row. Ignore all the red numbers again. These two rows are “Day” and “Night” readings.

### Two Rate Meters
There are different types of Two Rate Meters. Some only have one digital display, meaning that one reading might flash up after the other.

### Two Rate Meter (Type 1)
Write down the first five numbers from left to right on both of the rows, ignoring the red numbers again. That’s all you need to do.

### Two Rate Meter (Type 2)
This is the single display meter. First, write down the five numbers, not including the number with the word “RATE” above it. The number underneath “RATE” will indicate which energy rate you are reading, so will be either 1 or 2. To get the second number, press the button, and RATE 2 should come up. It’s the five numbers after this that you want. Write down both.

### Dial Meter
Make sure the dial meter you are reading is for your electricity and not your gas dial. Look at the first five dials from left to right. Now this might get complicated. Each of the dials go round in the opposite direction to the one next to it. You need to write down the number that the pointers on the dials have just passed. These are the numbers you want. If you only have four dials, but there are six boxes to fill in, just put 00 in the first two boxes, then your reading after.

## Conclusions

Having a "how to read your meter" page is vital in any energy firm, especially if you want your customers to be sending in their readings to you as accurately as possible.

It is necessary to separate gas and electricity.....

meters from smart meters, and use images to clearly illustrate the difference between each meter; for example, a single rate meter and a double rate meter.

Visual stimuli to support any statement you make when writing a page like this is vital for any customer to fully understand what reading a meter shows through a visual example.

It is also important after all of these explanations of how to read your meter, to feature an image that has numbers on. This way, a customer will be able to identify visually which meter is theirs, and not give an incorrect reading to their energy company. For example, in the image above, you would state, "Your reading here is *****".

So there you have it. The last extra information I would also recommend giving, would be - if online - a link to the FAQs page, details about perhaps where their electric meter is stored if they can't find it, and details of how to contact customer services if the customer is really in need of some help or stuck not being able to read or identify their meter. It might seem tedious, but remember, there are customers out there who have never made a meter reading before.

Being able to understand how a meter works and being able to read it is a real difficulty for many people, and if having a page explaining how meters work makes this easier, I believe it is a necessity for Logicor to feature something like this.
