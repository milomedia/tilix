      <p>Tilix undertakes assignments for the public good. This is professional work undertaken voluntarily and without payment. Unlike traditional volunteerism, it brings specific Tilix skills and expertise to those who are unable to afford them. In particular, Tilix looks to work with community groups that are doing innovative work in smart and digital energy.</p>

    <h3 id="joint-venture">Joint Venture</h3>
    <p>Tilix works with various partners (e.g. <a href="http://www.sustainabledirection.com">Sustainable Direction</a>, <a href="http://novazure.com">NovAzure</a>) on joint ventures. Here we share ownership, returns, risks, and governance. This is helping Tilix access new markets; gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; or to access skills and capabilities that are not a core strength.</p>
