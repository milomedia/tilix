		<h1>Smart &amp; Digital Energy in 2017</h1>

		   <p class="meta">15 Mar 2017</p>



		<div class="boxed">
		  <p>This post comprises three sections which discuss how digital transformation is playing out in the energy market in 2017. I take a power (electricity) centric view but their is interest here for the oil and gas sectors too.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/digital.png" alt="The Digital World"></p>

<p>First I take a domain view by outlining the shape of smart and digital transformation across the whole energy value chain. Then, I consider the view from the IT industry and how the power sector fits into their world view. Finally, I overview of some of conclusions based on my recent experience in smart energy and I suggest that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>digital transformation is the new business as usual for the energy sector.</li>
  <li>the energy industry has to continue to make fundamental changes in behaviour to flourish in the digital world.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="smartdigital-energy-in-2017">Smart/Digital Energy in 2017</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/carbon-silicon.png" alt="Carbon to Silicon"></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rodadams/2016/07/18/amory-lovins-invited-to-tell-navy-staff-about-electricity-and-oil-future/#5099c1893e1e">Oil is Obsolete</a>, Amory Lovins frames the current transformation in energy as being elemental.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first industrial revolution was the Age of Carbon, building our prosperity, security and the world’s mightiest industries out of coal and oil and gas. So now that obsolete age of carbon is giving way to the modern Age of Silicon. Silicon microchips, telecoms, software turn people from isolated to networked; systems from dumb to smart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silicon power electronics make electricity interconvertible and precisely controllable replacing fiery molecules with obedient electrons. Silicon solar cells enable the ascent of energy from mining the fires of hell to harvesting the breath and radiance of heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lovins is alluding to a combination of (mostly digital) technologies which will enable and shape increasing flexibility, sustainability and stability in the energy market.</p>

<p>My colleagues at Tilix and I work at the cutting edge of these technologies. Some of our areas of focus are outlined below, together with a short discussion of how digital transformation is playing out in each of these areas.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-generation">Distributed Generation</h3>
<p>Renewables account for around 25% of generation globally. More importantly, renewable electricity additions over the next five years will top 700 gigawatts (GW). In short, we are building lots of wind and solar and very little coal or nuclear. Source: <a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/MTRMR2015.pdf">IEA Renewable Energy Medium-Term Market Report</a></p>

<p>Digital technology is vitally important to renewables. Some of the areas where it is deployed include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locating sites to develop using GIS.</li>
  <li>Community engagement using social media</li>
  <li>Project management using online tools</li>
  <li>Modelling and design that incorporate artificial intelligence</li>
  <li>Operational control systems that are fine examples of industrial IoT.</li>
  <li>Drones</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="wind-power">Wind Power</h4>
<p>The UK is a great location for wind power. 11% of UK electricity generation in 2015 came from wind. Despite lack of government support for new onshore developments, the economics still make this an attractive investment. From 2010-15, costs for new plants fell by an estimated 30% on average. Over the next five years costs are expected to decline by a further 10%.</p>

<p>Offshore wind is expected to be a significant growth area in the UK, with bigger turbines and larger wind farms being developed. However, the economics here are arguably not as good as onshore and offshore wind will continue to require policy support.</p>

<h4 id="solar-pv">Solar PV</h4>
<p>In the past 10 years, solar has seen exponential growth. Given that solar PV is silicon based technology, it is no real surprise that it is seeing cost to performance improvements akin to those we see in semi-conductors. From 2010-15, the cost of new utility-scale solar PV declined by two-thirds. In the next five years costs will decline by an additional quarter. Despite the UK government’s cuts to subsides, solar PV is expected to grow in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="transmission--distribution---smart-grid">Transmission &amp; Distribution - Smart Grid</h3>
<p>The problem of controlling the grid to ensure stable power is no longer as simple as it used to be when we depended solely on large centrally controlled power plants.</p>

<p>In the age of distributed generation, electrical engineers and computer scientists are figuring out how keep power flowing. Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are growing globally and network operators are faced with the challenge of integrating low carbon energy technologies and operating a more flexible system. We now need real-time, autonomous and deterministic control solutions based on technologies like Active Network Management (ANM) and micro-Phasor Measurement Units (uPMU).</p>

<p>The usual suspects like ABB, Siemens and Schneider are active in this field. However, the rapid pace of change has produced good opportunities for start-ups. A fine example are [Smarter Grid Solutions][sgs] who offer a range of DER integration and control products and services.</p>

<h3 id="energy-storage">Energy Storage</h3>
<p>There are many signs that the energy storage industry is going to boom with striking similarity to the exponential takeoff of solar in recent years.</p>

<p>Deployments of energy storage solutions including batteries, pumped storage, hydrogen and flywheels are set to become significant the next few years.</p>

<p>Grid scale will account for the lion’s share of the market with industrial and commercial trailing second. Microgrids and domestic energy storage currently occupy a far smaller market share but hockey stick growth is expected in these segments to.</p>

<h3 id="smart-metering--connected-homes">Smart Metering &amp; Connected Homes</h3>
<p>Smart meters record consumption of energy and pass that info back to the utility companies for billing and other functions.</p>

<p>From 2015-2020, the UK’s the Smart Meter Implementation Programme (SMIP) will roll out more than 50 million smart gas and electricity meters.</p>

<p>This major national infrastructure undertaking is possibly the largest IoT project globally. In the first instance, this is a sustaining innovation that will help utilities reduce the costs associated with meter reading, balancing and settlement.</p>

<p>However, smart meters are also seen as an enabler technology that will drive disruptive innovation in the energy market. Some of the possibilities being mooted are 24 hour switching, variable rate tariffs and community network operations.</p>

<h3 id="retail---the-little-300">Retail - The Little 300</h3>
<p>The UK energy market has seen a steady growth in “independent suppliers”. For example in 2006 the total number of active domestic suppliers was 10. In Sep 2016 the total was 48. This growth in the domestic market is mirrored in the commercial supply market.</p>

<p>Although market conditions and government support has been important, an often overlooked ingredient has been digital technology. For example, since their inception, Ovo Energy have thought of themselves as a technology company:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We see ourselves as a technology company that delivers energy at the moment and possibly other things in future.” said Jason Sharpe in 2014 when he was MD of Ovo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several new entrants have come into the market with “smart from the start” strategies. They hope to leapfrog incumbents who may find it difficult to leverage the full benefits of the new technology. A key battle ground is in pre-payment. Here customers have been grossly underserved by the big six and smart metering provides a way to significantly improve the customer experience.</p>

<h3 id="electric-vehicles">Electric Vehicles</h3>
<p><img src="http://1gtdl28x8fv3qef1k19jnfr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/final_uniti_anim_00.01.png" alt="This Swedish electric car is coming to save the world."></p>

<p>Since 2007, the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car">Revenge of the Electric Car</a></em> has been a remarkable story. The early pace setters were Elon Musk’s Tesla and Carlos Ghosn’s Nissan Leaf. In the UK, new registrations of plug-in cars increased from 3,500 in 2013 to around 85,000 by January 2017.</p>

<p>Most major car manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon and the pipeline of new EVs coming to the market is staggering. The EV market is also a happy hunting ground for start-ups looking to disrupt the automotive sector e.g. <a href="http://www.unitisweden.com">Uniti Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>Continue increases in EVs could put additional strain on energy networks. Especially if they are charged at peak times. However,  on the other hand, EVs offer great opportunities for benefiting the grid through demand side response and mobile energy storage use case.</p>

<h3 id="energy-efficiency">Energy Efficiency</h3>
<p>Currently available intelligent efficiency opportunities, that leverage digital technologies like IoT, machine learning and big data could help reduce energy use by as much as 20 per percent.</p>

<p>LED lighting is silicon based technology make it possible to save more than 50% of the electricity consumption for lighting (20% of the totally consumed electrical energy).</p>

<p>The steady improvement, over many years, of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is predicted by Haitz’s Law. It states that every decade, the cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10, and the amount of light generated per LED package increases by a factor of 20, for a given wavelength of light. This improvement is due to the process optimisation of the production of semiconductor devices.</p>

<p>For many, the energy efficiency of LED lighting is just the beginning. Intelligent LED fixtures and sensor-based smart building applications are now available that help drive productivity and create a safer, more engaging work environment.</p>

<h3 id="demand-side-response">Demand Side Response</h3>
<p>IoT platforms could enable real-time management of residential household loads on a massive scale. By aggregating power capacity of hundreds of thousands of flexible electrical loads, this technology will be able to reduce the need for peaking power plant by shifting MW levels of residential power demand on a variable time response basis.</p>

<p>Expect to see DSR pilots with variable £/kW rate depending on speed of response and guarantee of despatch. For example, delayed start of washing machine from push messaging pays less than automated control of loads</p>

<h3 id="connected-communities--microgrids">Connected Communities &amp; Microgrids</h3>
<p>It’s safe to say that “Cyberville” relies on power.</p>

<p>Smart communities are powered by electricity…</p>

<p>Smart microgrids offer great promise to improve power reliability. They are most commonly found serving industrial and commercial facilities, university and research facilities, military bases, and remote off-grid systems.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-sector--the-3rd-platform">The Power Sector &amp; the 3rd Platform</h2>
<p>The third platform is a term IDC that encapsulates the inter-dependencies between mobile computing, social media, cloud computing, and information / analytics (big data), and possibly the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Gartner calls this the “Nexus of Forces” and claims that these interdependent trends are “transforming the way people and businesses relate to technology”.</p>

<p>Some of the most hyped technologies spinning out of the 3rd platform include drones, blockchain, wearables and VR.</p>

<h3 id="drones">Drones</h3>
<p>this topic is close to my heart because in the 90’s, I earned a PhD for research relating to autonomous and remotely submersibles for applications including exploration and inspection.</p>

<p>Low costs and light weight materials have made drones widely available in commercial and leisure settings.  It is no surprise that on the grid, utilities are using drones to inspect plant, carry out security operations, and assess storm damage.</p>

<p>In end use environments, drones can help installation and maintenance of solar systems. They could reduce time spent on roofs thus bringing down costs and improving safety.</p>

<h3 id="wearables--vr">Wearables &amp; VR</h3>
<p>Wearables and virtual reality (VR) headsets carry much hype and promise. A key feature of wearables is simply that don’t have to hold the device. For many in the field being hands-free is a requirement for intelligent and safe work.</p>

<p>The substation walk through demonstration from Space-Time Insight at DistribuTECH 2015 in San Diego was a fine example of an application in the utility sector. Equally interesting is the ability to overlay real-time information right into the user’s line of sight. A good illustration of this was outlined in a project that Inglobe delivered for Huawei Technologies to provide its technicians AR-enhanced tools to carry out common tasks more efficiently. <a href="http://www.impomag.com/article/2016/10/case-study-augmented-reality-maintenance-technicians">See IPMO Mag for a case study</a>.</p>

<p>Inside buildings, sensors embedded in smart watches or in clothing could feed body temperature information to heating systems with the levels being adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h3>
<p>Blockchain, which was first implemented in 2009, securely records transactions in a decentralised way for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years, blockchain has hit the hype cycle with a bang as its potential in other applications emerges. In the energy sector there are several concepts, pilots and tech start-ups investigating how blockchain can be used to record transactions in distributed grids. Innovators to look out for include LO3 Energy, Open Utility and Power Ledger.</p>

<h3 id="3d-printing">3D Printing</h3>

<h2 id="is-digital-transformation-the-new-business-as-usual">Is digital transformation the new business as usual?</h2>
<p>The challenge for the energy incumbents is described perfectly by <a href="https://www.siemens.com/customer-magazine/en/home/energy/power-transmission-and-distribution/the-rise-of-the-energy-insurgents.html">Amory Lovins in Siemens’ Magazine</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[they] have to figure out different ways to use their assets, capabilities and, most difficultly, cultures to compete in a very different market. This change in the market is coming at them at a speed they can scarcely imagine and much faster than their cultures will find it easy to cope with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lovins is alluding to the stuff described earlier in this post. I firmly believe that this is becoming the new business as usual for the energy sector.</p>

<h3 id="digital-energy-requires-continuous-innovation">Digital energy requires continuous innovation</h3>
<p>It will be a rough ride to the future. I know from other industries that being lean and agile is a key to success. I also know that it is easy to be AINO - Agile In Name Only.</p>

<p>Successful players in the digitally transformed energy sector will adopt the right approach for their market. For consumers approaches like Lean Startup will be important. The pillars of this method are …</p>

<p>However, for business customers … and so different approaches will be required.</p>

<h3 id="inevitable--intermingled">Inevitable &amp; Intermingled</h3>
<p>…to be written</p>
<ul>
  <li>Systems of Record</li>
  <li>Systems of Engagement</li>
  <li>Systems of Intelligence</li>
</ul>

<p>Two key challenges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engaging customers &amp; making it easy for them to do business</li>
  <li>Integrating all these systems</li>
</ul>
