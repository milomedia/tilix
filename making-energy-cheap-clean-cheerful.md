    Tilix uses retained earnings to support nascent, potentially game changing ideas in smart energy.

    Impact investing is proving to be a great way for Tilix to adapt to the emerging smart energy market. It is also a small but important contribution to winning the fossil fuel end game.

    This approach has the potential to scale across a number of dimensions. For example, Tilix is building a syndicate to help share research and pool the resources of other likeminded angels.

    undertaken voluntarily and without payment. Unlike traditional volunteerism, it
    brings specific Tilix skills and expertise to those who are unable to afford them.
    In particular, Tilix looks to work with community groups that are doing innovative
    work in smart and digital energy.

  headline: Joint venture
  text: Tilix works with various partners (e.g. [Sustainable Direction](http://www.sustainabledirection.com/),
    [NovAzure](http://novazure.com/)) on joint ventures. Here we share ownership,
    returns, risks, and governance. This is helping Tilix access new markets; gain
    scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; or to access skills and
    capabilities that are not a core strength.
