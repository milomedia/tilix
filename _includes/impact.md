## Impact Investing
Tilix uses retained earnings to support nascent, potentially game changing ideas in smart energy. For example, Tilix has a small number of strategic investments in start ups where entrepreneurial CEOs value the cash, advice, knowledge transfer and connections Tilix provides.

Impact investing is proving to be a great way for Tilix to adapt to the emerging smart energy market. It is also a small but important contribution to winning the fossil fuel end game.
