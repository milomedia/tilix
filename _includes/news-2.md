**Uniti is an electric city car** designed to be agile in urban environments, with a unique and contemporary approach to safety, sustainability and user experience.

As early stage investors and advisors, Tilix are enjoying the [journey from concept to the roads in less than 4 years][4]. We are super excited about the progress of the current crowd funding and the partnership with Siemens for mass production.

We are looking forward to helping Uniti establish their new production facility in Landskrona and launch their new electric car on 7th December 2017.
