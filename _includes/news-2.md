## Impact Investing
![Uniti EV in Media Markt, Malmo][3]

Tilix uses retained earnings to support nascent, potentially game changing ideas in smart energy. Tilix has a small number of strategic investments in clean-tech and smart energy start ups. These entrepreneurs value the cash, advice, knowledge transfer and connections Tilix provides.

This *angel investing* is proving to be a great way for Tilix to adapt to the emerging smart energy market. It is also a small but important contribution to winning the fossil fuel end game.

One of our key angel investments is with [**Uniti EV**](https://www.uniti.earth) who have designed a *premium electric city car* with a unique approach to safety, sustainability and user experience.

Tilix are enjoying the [journey from concept to the roads in less than 4 years][4]. We are super excited about the progress Uniti has made in forming partnerships with Siemens and Kuka for mass production. We are delighted to support Uniti in securing Series A funding later in 2018.
