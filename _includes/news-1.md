## Open Innovation
![Audience at IdeaLondon][4]

Open, progressive and ground breaking innovation is at the heart of everything that Tilix does. Effective sharing of ideas, opinions and information is vital for success in the transformation to smart and digital energy.Therefore, Tilix enjoys educating and sharing knowledge with our energy industry colleagues. Thatâ€™s why we have our own blogs, white papers and seminars. We are regularly invited to speak at events and write for professional publications.

At Tilix Seminars industry experts share best practice and experience that is relevant to parties across the whole energy value chain. There are valuable insights and analysis for those who are at the cutting edge or are just starting to find out about smart energy.

Please read [our blog][3] and/or [join our mailing list][2] if you'd like to learn more about quarterly Tilix Smart Energy Masterclass events.
