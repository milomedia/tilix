![Audience at Watershed][1]

Open, progressive and ground breaking innovation is at the heart of everything that Tilix does.

Tilix is currently sharing GDPR tools, tips and techniques through a series of seminars, most recently in [Bristol](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/preparing-for-gdpr-free-workshop-tickets-42862709518). Read our [Preliminary Analysis of the GDPR Survey](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2017/10/26/GDPR-Survey).

At Tilix Seminars industry experts share best practice and experience that is relevant to parties across the whole energy value chain. There are valuable insights and analysis for those who are at the cutting edge or are just starting to find out about smart energy.

Please [join our mailing list][2] if you'd like to hear about future Tilix events. Through 2018, we will have one seminar per quarter. The working titles are "Digital Transformation in Energy", "Optimising Supply Businesses" and "Innovation in Energy".

Effective sharing of ideas, opinions and information is vital for success in the transformation to smart and digital energy.Therefore, Tilix enjoys educating and sharing knowledge with our energy industry colleagues. Thatâ€™s why we have our own blogs, white papers and seminars. We are regularly invited to speak at events and write for professional publications.
