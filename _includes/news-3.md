![Logicor Energy][1]

**Logicor is a pioneer in energy**. Their flag ship products are credible replacements for existing gas and electric heating.

The [Clear Heater System][2] is an all-electric phased infrared radiant heating system using patented technology. The [InLine Hot Water System][3] is powered by electricity and can replace your existing water boiler and storage tank in your home.

[Entering the electricity supply market][4] will enable Logicor to help customers reduce their energy bills even further. In record time, during spring and summer 2017, Tilix integrated the systems required for Logicor to supply electricity. We look forward to supporting Logicor through full market entry and beyond.
