## Consulting
![Heating Reimagined][1]

As well as having expertise in electrical engineering, EVs, battery storage, renewables and energy efficiency, Tilix consultants know the gnarly details of buying, selling, moving & metering energy.

The dynamics of price and volume in competitive retail markets are complex. Our team has experience of managing CME as well understanding how customers are won, lost and transfer between products in BAU situations.

One of our key clients is [**Logicor**][2], the Wakefield based pioneer in energy. Their flag ship products are all electric space and water heaters. Tilix led projects are instrumental in setting up [Logicor Energy][3] as a licensed electricity supply business.
