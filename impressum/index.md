## Health, Safety and Environment Management
Tilix employs less than 5 employees, so are not legally obliged to have written health, safety and environment policies. However, we deem health and safety for our employees and contractors to be of highest priority and importance and have a [short HSE policy statement](hse.html).

Our HSE considerations are mostly about office and travel safety. Tilix applies the customs and practice it has adopted in recent projects for Telefonica, Capita and National Grid. For example, with National Grid we have recently worked at 400kV substations. It was encouraging to find that Tilix custom and practice aligned naturally with National Grid’s world class safety procedures
