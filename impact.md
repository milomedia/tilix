    Tilix uses retained earnings to support nascent, potentially game changing ideas in smart energy.

    Impact investing is proving to be a great way for Tilix to engage in the low carbon economy. It is also a small but important contribution to winning the fossil fuel end game.

    This approach is being scaled across a number of dimensions. For example, Tilix is at the heart of a circle of like minded angels who share research and pool resources.

  headline: Microfinance
  text: Small scale social enterprises can leverage Tilix capital to help deliver
    their mission. We have a strong preference for helping organisations which address
    fuel poverty and air quality. These deals are typically in the form of a loan
    or sponsorship.
