# CyberEssentials

Tilix is pleased to offer support to start-up and SMEs who would like to obtain Cyber Essentials. This can be in the form of ad hoc advisory or as a turnkey solution.

## About Cyber Essentials

Certification provides reassurance that your defences will protect against the vast majority of common cyber attacks. The scope of Cyber Essentials includes:

* **Boundary firewalls and internet gateways** - all networks should have a properly configured firewall.
* **Secure configuration** - default configurations are often vulnerable, these need to be made secure.
* **User access controls** - only the correct, authorised people can access systems.
* **Malware protection** - protection against malware and other viruses.
* **Patch management** - all software and systems should have the latest security patches installed.
