Tilix regularly helps its clients leverage the same Microsoft services that are at the heart of its own business architecture, such as Github, Azure, Office 365 and LinkedIn.

Therefore, it was a natural next step in Tilix's evolution to formally become a member of the Microsoft Partner Network. Tilix is pleased to announce that it has now joined this network of companies of all sizes and across all industries that work with Microsoft to drive transformation, build pivotal relationships and scale their businesses. This is the most powerful community of its kind – larger than Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce combined.

According to Tilix CxO, Neil Williams:

> The Microsoft Partnership is a key part of the Tilix growth strategy for the next five years. I am confident that partnering with Microsoft will pay off. Tilix can now easily connect with the largest customer base and marketplaces in the IT industry. This is about the power of opportunity driven by a shared goal: customer success.

## Tilix can define its own opportunities with Microsoft

For Microsoft, partners and our customers, the future is in the cloud. The immense and rapid changes associated with the cloud journey, digital transformation and the new world of tech intensity, where every company is an innovator, are unlocking limitless opportunities for partners on the Microsoft platform. The Microsoft Partner Network provides resources, programs and tools that empower partners to capture those opportunities throughout our thriving ecosystem and across the globe.

Wherever customers are in their transformation, you can meet them there, with the strength of Microsoft tools and technologies to turn ideas into solutions. Microsoft offers true flexibility to choose the mix of cloud and on-premises technologies that works best for each customer – freeing you to innovate and give customers more and better opportunities to succeed. Partnership with Microsoft empowers you to create differentiated solutions and meaningful innovations so you can stand out in a competitive landscape.

When you join a Microsoft partner programme, you become part of a global community that connects you to the relationships, insights, tools, resources and programs you need to amaze your customers and drive business growth.

The Microsoft Partner Network gives you the widest range of products in the industry as well as program options to differentiate your business, go to market and sell your solutions. Join at no cost, then choose how to invest in your partnership with a Microsoft action pack, starter kit or competency.

As you achieve your business goals, participate in the programme at the level that suits your unique needs to access more benefits and develop your relationship with us and other partners in the network.

## The partnership roadmap

To find detailed information about the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN), visit [the MPN website](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-GB/). In summary, the Microsoft partnership roadmap is as simple as ABC:

A. **Partner with Microsoft**: Get connected with the Microsoft ecosystem. Access training, practice-building guidance, and sales and marketing resources.

B. **Choose your path:** Consider an Action Pack if you're just getting started, or attain a competency that demonstrates your expertise.

C. **Grow your business:** Find tools, resources, support and guidance to reach new customers and accelerate business growth.

Tilix is at Step B. In particular, we are planning an Action Pack with Grey Matter and Microsoft.

## Grey Matter

As a boutique consultancy, the best way for Tilix to engage with the Microsoft ecosystem is through a "wholesale partner". The perfect fit here is Grey Matter: the industry-leading B2B software solutions and services reseller. The firm has over 30 years of technical and business software know-how and provides an extensive selection of the best cloud, database, security, development and mapping platforms for software developers and IT professionals.

Grey Matter focuses on building long-term partnerships with their customers by understanding their business priorities and objectives, and recommending the most cost-effective and relevant solution.
