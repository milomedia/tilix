Tilix regularly helps its clients leverage the same Microsoft services, such as Github, Azure, Office 365 and LinkedIn, that are at the heart of its own business architecture.

Therefore, it was a natural next step in Tilix's evolution to formally become a member of the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN). Tilix is pleased to announce that it has now joined this network of companies of all sizes and across all industries that work with Microsoft to drive transformation, build pivotal relationships and scale their businesses. This is the most powerful community of its kind â€“ larger than Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce combined.

According to Tilix CxO, Neil Williams:

> The Microsoft Partnership is a key part of the Tilix growth strategy for the next five years. I am confident that partnering with Microsoft will pay off. Tilix can now easily connect with the largest customer base and marketplaces in the IT industry. This is about the power of opportunity driven by a shared goal: customer success.

## Tilix can define its own opportunities with Microsoft

The immense and rapid changes associated with the cloud journey, digital transformation and the new world of tech intensity, where every company is an innovator, are unlocking limitless opportunities for partners on the Microsoft platform. The MPN provides resources, programs and tools that will empower Tilix to capture opportunities locally and globally.

Wherever our clients are in their transformation process, Tilix can meet them there, supported by Microsoft tools and technologies to turn ideas into solutions. Thanks to Microsoft, we can offer true flexibility to choose the mix of cloud and on-premises technologies that works best for our clients. Our partnership with Microsoft empowers us to create differentiated solutions and meaningful innovations for our clients so they can stand out in a competitive landscape.

Joining the MPN has enabled Tilix to become part of a global community that connects us to the relationships, insights, tools, resources and programmes we need to amaze our clients and drive business growth.

The MPN provides us with the widest range of products in the industry as well  options to differentiate Tilix, go to market and sell solutions.

## The partnership roadmap

The Tilix/Microsoft partnership roadmap is as simple as ABC:

A. **Partner with Microsoft:** Access training, practice-building guidance, and sales and marketing resources.

B. **Action pack:** To accelerate business development and grow competency.

C. **Bottom line growth:** Leverage the tools, resources, support and guidance to reach new customers and achieve more.

Tilix is at Step B. In particular, we are planning an Action Pack with Grey Matter and Microsoft.

## Grey Matter

As a boutique consultancy, the best way for Tilix to engage with the Microsoft ecosystem is through a "wholesale partner". The perfect fit here is Grey Matter: the industry-leading B2B software solutions and services reseller. The firm has over 30 years of technical and business software know-how and offers an extensive array of the best cloud, database, security, development and mapping platforms for software developers and IT professionals.

Grey Matter focuses on building long-term partnerships with its customers by understanding their business priorities and objectives, and recommending the most cost-effective and relevant solution.

Regarding Tilix, Grey Matter Account Manager, [Lisa Flemming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-flemming-2ba79517/), said:
