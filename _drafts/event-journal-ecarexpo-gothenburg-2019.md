eCarExpo is the Nordic region's leading trade show on e-mobility. It is a great event for industry and consumers. There are electric vans, cars, bikes and scooters many of which you can test drive directly from the exhibition floor.

The fair undoubtedly shows that improving the environment and our sustainability electric mobility can be fun for car owners and car enthusiasts.

As well as vehicles, visitors got an overview of the products and services that make up the whole market. At the 2019 Gothenburg event it was interesting to see EV charging business model innovation from [Smart City Charger](http://smartcitycharger.com).

in 2020, eCarExpo will be spreading itself across Sweden, Denmark and Norway:

* Friends Arena, Stockholm, 7-9 February 2020
* Øksnehallen, Copenhagen, 17-19 April 2020
* Lilleström, Oslo, 20-22 November 2020.

## Do more than kick the tires

At eCarExpo Gothenburg, the audience was able to test drive about 50 cars out in the city's traffic, directly out of the exhibition floor. The choice included more than 30 fully electric and hybrid models which are currently available to buy in the Swedish market.

> We have the largest test fleet ever this year. Most car brands, some 50 cars and some 30 completely new electric car and charging hybrid models will be able to be run by the audience. **Gunnar Dackevall, Founder and manager of eCarExpo**

In the premium bracket, visitors can test the Jaguar iPace, Range Rover Sport PHEV and the BMW X5 45e charging hybrid (which makes its Swedish premiere). BMW also brought the hot new 330e as well as its i3, 530e xDrive and 225xe.

From the mid-market, visitors can check out several of Kia's electric and rechargeable models, new Hyundai IONIQ Electric and Kona Electric, new updated Renault Zoe and Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and several other new models that have not yet been revealed.

For the particularly environmentally conscious, the Omotion ETR provides a low carbon footprint. Although great fun, this lightweight three-wheeled and two-seat motorcycle will not be a practical solution for families or travelling salespeople.
