Autumn Equinox 2020 in the Northern Hemisphere will be at 14:30 (UK time) on Tuesday, 22 September.

The Autumnal/Fall Equinox north of the equator is mirrored south of the equator by the Spring Equinox. The word comes from the Latin _aequus_, meaning “equal” and _nox_, meaning “night.”

During the equinox, the sun crosses what we call the “celestial equator”. Imagine a line that marks the equator on Earth extending up into the sky above the equator from north to south.

After the Autumnal Equinox the days shorten and nights lengthen. In astrology this is the date on which the sun enters the sign of Libra, the scales, reflecting appropriately the balanced day and night of the equinox.

## Satellite Disruptions

The days before and after an equinox, Satellites are vulnerable to “Sun outages”disruptions.

During an equinox, the sun is aligned directly behind satellites in geostationary orbit at the Equator and satellites are flooded with direct solar radiation.

Many communications satellites orbit around the Equator and the solar radiation they experience can interfere with and even stop them transmitting signals. Thus consumers may experience slow Internet connections or frozen television screens during equinoctial sun outages.
