Tilix is proud to become Utilities Vendor Database (**UVDB**) certified after having its Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (**SHEQ**) capabilities accredited by Achilles.

This UVDB certification allows Tilix to pre-qualify as an approved supplier to the utilities sector. The UVDB business system makes it easier for companies in the utilities sector to manage their supply chain risks and to comply with procurement regulations.

The certification validates Tilix’s commitment to continually provide the highest quality of service to clients. It indicates the firm’s compliance with key legislation, particularly in terms of SHEQ and corporate social responsibility.

## **About UVDB**

The utilities market is fast moving, subject to ever more stringent regulation and new technologies. UVDB is a rigorous pre-qualification scheme used across the UK that is designed to allow utilities to seek expressions of interest in advance for certain categories of contracts. Working closely with key buying organisations in the sector, this community helps them achieve the highest standards of supply chain assurance.

Achilles UVDB acts as a central repository for tenders and supplier selection for some of the biggest players in the UK utilities industry including National Grid, Scottish Power, SSE and Thames Water.

* Industry: Utilities
* Buyers: 65
* Region: Northern Europe
* Qualified Suppliers: 7,100

Tilix has been granted UVDB Qualified status. This demonstrates our compliance to SHEQ requirements based on industry-specific assessments and also reflects our ongoing commitment to both robust management systems and the highest operational standards.

Achilles enables communities of buyers and suppliers to build better business relationships through a more open, trusting and proactive approach.

### Key features

* **Enhanced profiling:** Allow buyers to apply their internal benchmarking standards to the Tilix profile, giving them an easier way to gauge suitability.
* **Insights report:** Regular updates that allows Tilix to benchmark performance against peers and identify business improvements.
* **Relevant audit protocols:** Industry specific protocols backed by comprehensive reporting and expert advice on improvement plans.

### Technical bits

A detailed coding system has been developed by Achilles which works alongside the European CPV codes allowing suppliers to register to be considered for certain types of contracts. 

Where a utility is covered by the EU Utilities Directive 2014/25/EU, UVDB can be used to ensure compliance with the process of compiling a tender list from a list of pre-qualified suppliers. Selecting suppliers from a qualification system is permitted under the Directive for the restricted, negotiated, competitive dialogue and innovation partnerships procedures.

## The bottom line

This certification demonstrates Tilix’s SHEQ capabilities and highlights our clear understanding of the sector’s requirements. It provides Tilix with the following benefits:

* Directly showcases our capability profile and suitability for major contracts to 80 sector organisations and over 3,000 buyers.
* Saves time and money in repetitive pre-qualification.
* Helps us to win new and existing business through a fair, open and transparent selection process.
* Generates competitive presence and awareness.

Being UVDB qualified puts Tilix on a par with leading companies in the UK and shows that our capability to provide services to the utilities sector is proven. All our clients can rest assured that we comply with all legislation, thereby safeguarding their businesses.
