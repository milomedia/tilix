## The Challenge

2020 is a difficult time for entering the GB electricity supply market. COVID-19 has added to the increasing demands placed on new entrants by the regulator. However, fortune favours the brave and those with good strategy. The founder Shahrukh Ali knows there is no such thing as “we can do it all”. From the outset he sought out supply chain partners who could help his team soar with its strengths. As well as electricity industry expertise, he looks for partners who:

* A strategic viewpoint including advisory on marketing and innovation. Particularly around changes in the economic, commercial and regulatory environment.
* Architectural contributions to the building of an effective organization that is fit for purpose in the present and is prepared for success in the future.
* Governance to ensure that the firm operates in a legal and ethical manner while meeting the business objectives.
* Maintain strong relationships with Ofgem and other industry bodies on compliance and policy development.
* Constructive challenge and the gravitas of having advisors who will say “no” when necessary.

Tilix was up for this challenge and is proud to have delivered a robust and scalable enterprise architecture for Champion Energy™.

## Tilix Approach

Tilix worked as an enterprise architect and partnership broker to help Champion Energy push forwards with its plans. In summary the solution mobilised includes:

* The core Champion Energy™ team provides the “front office” operations.
* Tilix provides the “back office” operations, digital engineering and the CRM platform.
* USS provides the messaging conduit to the electricity industry coupled with advisory services around regulation and industry codes.
* Tilix provides TUG software to integrate systems of record across electricity industry operations, customer relationship management and accounting.

As expected, their depth of industry knowledge and skills were first class. More importantly, their ability to flex to Champion's unique requirements and the challenging market conditions around COVID-19 highlights their professionalism."_
