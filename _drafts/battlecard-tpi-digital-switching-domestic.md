Details from a number of service providers have been analysed by tilix.energy and are published in the Battlecard: TPI/Digital Switching (Domestic). This market research is for suppliers, TPIs, Investors and Regulators. It provides:

* An outline of the activities of the top TPIs in providing digital switching services for households.
* An index and profile of more than a dozen services and their market performance (finances, employee numbers, etc).
* A market segmentation which outlines trends and challenges.

Industry professionals can use this research to track the major issues affecting service providers. In particular, it will help energy suppliers identify who is best to engage with around customer acquisition. For service providers it gives a benchmark against competition and identifies opportunities in the market.

# At a Glance
Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs) are a key part of the energy market. TPIs include switching websites, energy brokers and energy efficiency advice providers who interact with energy consumers and provide insights to licensed suppliers. TPIs can offer advice and products to assist with a range of functions including energy procurement, efficiency and management.

Over time TPI services within Great Britain’s gas and electricity retail markets have increased. Given market developments, including faster switching and smart metering the TPI market is widely expected to evolve and proliferate.

This battlecard considers digital switching services for domestic consumers. In this market there are a number of choices for consumers and suppliers alike. NB the primary audience for the battlecard is business people in retail supply (“suppliers”) and TPIs. However, its content may also be of interest to some consumers. The key sections are:

- **Marketplace Conditions**: The size of the market, service penetration rates, estimated market demand, Ofgem’s roadmap and other relevant data
