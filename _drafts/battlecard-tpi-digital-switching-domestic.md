Details from a number of service providers have been analysed by tilix.energy and are published in the Battlecard: TPI/Digital Switching (Domestic) from tilix.energy is for suppliers, TPIs, Investors and Regulators. It provides:

* A market report, updated quarterly, summarising activities of the top TPIs in providing digital switching services for households.
* An index and profile of more than a dozen services and their market performance (finances, employee numbers, etc).
* Segments the market, outlining trends and challenges in each.

Use it to track the major issues affecting service providers. In particular, it will help energy suppliers identify who is best to engage with to help you acquire customers. For service providers it gives a benchmark against competition and identifies opportunities in the market.

# At a Glance
Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs) are a key part of the energy market. TPIs include switching websites, energy brokers and energy efficiency advice providers who interact with energy consumers and provide insights to licensed suppliers. TPIs can offer advice and products to assist with a range of functions including energy procurement, efficiency and management.

Over time TPI services within Great Britain’s gas and electricity retail markets have increased. Given market developments, including faster switching and smart metering it the TPI market is widely expected to evolve and proliferate.

This battlecard considers digital switching services for domestic consumers. In this market there are a number of choices for consumers and suppliers alike. NB the primary audience for the battlecard is business people in retail supply (“suppliers”) and TPIs. However, its content may also be of interest to some consumers.

# Marketplace Conditions

Understanding how the significant number of digital switching services operate in the market can be a challenge, particularly as the broader TPI sector diversifies.

Digital switching services are not subject to direct sectoral regulation in the same way as energy suppliers by Ofgem. They are subject to regulation under general consumer protection rules, and in some cases have signed up to voluntary agreements governing their business practices and interactions with consumers.

Guidance from Ofgem is ever evolving. They are mindful of the potential benefits and risks associated with the growing market. They are currently progressing a number of projects that consider improvements in services that will enhance consumer experience of engaging with digital switching.

Ofgem’s TPI Programme is considering the enduring long term regulatory framework for TPIs as well as bespoke regulatory measures to address specific segments of the energy retail markets covering household and business consumers. Alongside this, technology is changing through SMIP and the Switching Programme.

The TPI/Digital Switching (Domestic) Battlecard includes further information on:

* The size of the market
* Service penetration rates
* Estimated market demand
* Ofgem’s roadmap
* Other relevant data

# Target Customer Segments

TPIs who operate within the energy market do so under a wide range of business models and serve a range of consumers from household consumers to large business consumers.

Customer acquisition approaches in the domestic market typically fall between the two extremes of over-dependence on brokers and avoidance of brokers.

Over dependence can lead to disaster. For example, several industry experts believe that GB Energy failed because it received more customers than it could handle from broker channels.

Like Directline in the insurance market, some suppliers want to cut out the middleman. However, it remains to been seen if a successful energy company can afford to completely avoid TPIs.

The battlecard contains further customer profile information. This goes beyond demographics and will include information about:

* Differentiators
* Leadership style
* Current mode of execution
* Organisational maturity
* Strategic focus

# Product Features

The digital switching service value proposition offers rapid growth with manageable economics. At its heart, the job is to act as a conduit for energy contracts offered by a supplier to a consumer. Unlike in many other industries, the intermediary offers very little added value to the transaction and consumers may get just as good a deal by direct trading.

Common usage includes the insurance, and financial services industry where e.g. mortgage brokers, insurance broker, and financial advisers offer intermediation services in the supply of financial products such as mortgage loans, insurance, and investment products.

In the digital switching of energy, service providers offer means an internet-based price comparison service for domestic gas and electricity consumers, which can be a website or app. A good service will include price comparisons for all available domestic tariffs, where applicable for all available payment types, for licensed suppliers (including for any agents, affiliates, and brands operating under the licence of a supplier), for gas, electricity and dual fuel.

In summary, a licensed supplier should consider the following when assessing a digital switching service provider:

* **Track record**: As well as quality and quantity of marquee clients, look for cases that resonate.
* **Structure**: Does the approach provide the right level of perspective and control?
* **Agility**: Can the vendor scale? This doesn't just mean can they handle volume. It also concerns how flexible they are in meeting bespoke requirements.
* **Expertise**: Look for T-shaped offers with a wide range of digital marketing experience coupled with recent and relevant expertise in the GB retail energy market.

The full battle card includes the following information:

* Product specifics, in customer-centric language.
* Relationships with other parts of the technology and services eco-system in the GB energy supply market.
* Up to date information about time-bound promotions from vendors (updated quarterly).
