**Venue:** Clarion Sign, Stockholm, Sweden

Sweden Sustaintech Venture Day (SSVD) is a capital market day focusing on sustainable solutions. SSVD is a vibrant forum for investors who want to get involved in Swedish companies who are accelerating the energy transition and helping the world get to where it needs to be.

In 2020 SSVD gave investors, business angels, venture capitalists and mutual funds and industry companies a valuable opportunity to listen to presentations and meet over thirty of the most interesting companies in the fast growing sustaintech sector.

## A Royal seal of approval

The event attracted over 400 participants, mostly investors. It was inaugurated by HKH Prince Daniel. During his opening speech Prince Daniel said:

_“No matter what business you are in, no matter how brilliant your ideas are: If you want to grow - if you want to reach those first 50 million users fast - you will probably need capital and you will definitely need people who believe in you.”_

The Prince spoke with a number of companies, including smart materials, recycling and renewable energy. His insights were appreciated by attendees and organisers alike.

_It is a great asset for Sweden to have a prince with real life experience as an entrepreneur. It was a fantastic speech by HRH Prince Daniel at SSVD._ **Boel Rydenå-Swartling, Organiser/Investor**.
