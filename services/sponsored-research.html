          <h3>Tilix Research FAQ</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>How long does it take to execute a research project?</strong> 2 months is the average duration but shorter or longer projects are quite common. </li>
              <li><strong>How long are research reports?</strong> It depends on the type of report, the subject chosen, as well as other factors. Tilix reports range from 5 page market overviews or appraisals to upwards of 60 pages for in-depth studies.</li>
              <li><strong>Can I ask Tilix to validate our claims?</strong> Absolutely. We are happy to act as an independent 3rd party to validate your company's claims about its products or services. However, we don’t guarantee the outcome. If it is unfavourable, you should treat the report as internal lessons learnt rather than marketing collateral.  </li>
              <li><strong>Are research projects expensive?</strong> The entry price for Tilix research projects is significantly lower than other similar products and services on the market. This is possible because Tilix has low overheads and diversified revenue streams.</li>
              <li><strong>Can Tilix Work as part of a consortium?</strong> Absolutely! There is no such thing as end to end or “we can do it all”. That’s why Tilix maintains symbiotic partnerships with our peers in academia, market research and innovation consulting.</li>
