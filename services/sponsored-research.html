          <h3>The Need for Research</h3>
          <p>The whole energy system is going through major transformations and
            the rate of change is increasing exponentially.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, research has never been more critical in helping
            government and industry increase the stock of knowledge on local,
            regional, national and international problems and opportunities in
            energy.<strong></strong></p>
