  headline: Key Challenges
  text: |
    Tilix are well versed in the challenges of modern business. This includes launching a venture or project; saving a business or initiative that has gone off the rails; dealing with accelerated growth; re-energising a team that has lost its leadership position; or maintaining the legacy of a successful leader who has moved on.

    In any situation there are the usual business constraints of time, cost, quality and scope. As experienced managers, Tilix know how to plan, monitor and control projects and operations. Where there are competing demands, Tilix are adept at making necessary adjustments to keep things on track.

    In recent years, by far the most common challenge for businesses have been around incorporating digital into business architectures.

    Digital transformation is often focussed on technological advances such as social, AI, IoT, cloud, big data, mobile, industry 4.0 etc. However, it is best thought of as a way of empowering people to solve their traditional problems in a digital way or to enable new types of innovation and creativity.

    While the impact of digital on energy and cleantech has been profound, there are many in these industries who have not yet exploited its full potential.

    Tilix clients are customer obsessed. Tilix supports customer centricity by helping our clients create business models and operations that delight their increasingly mobile, social, informed and global audiences.

    A few years ago, mentioning Thinking People Systems, Theory of Constraints, Cost of Delay, Throughput Accounting etc to someone from a utility company would lead to a wry smile. Lean and agile were definitely on the radar but there was too much resistance to overcome in a sector thatâ€™s driven by regulations and compliance. The conversation has now shifted to:

    > How can we become more agile and do it at scale?

    Tilix clients who avoid or move away from top-down, hierarchical command and control approaches to doing business are finding themselves better able to cope with extremes such as 10x accelerated growth despite operating in challenging regulatory, economic and technological environments.
