  headline: Tilix Research FAQ
  text: |
    * **How long does it take to execute a research project?** Two months is the average duration but shorter or longer projects are quite common.
    * **How long are research reports?** It depends on the type of report, the subject chosen, as well as other factors. Tilix reports range from five-page market overviews or appraisals to upwards of 60 pages for in-depth studies.
    * **Can I ask Tilix to validate our claims?** Absolutely. We are happy to act as an independent third party to validate your company’s claims about its products and/or services. However, we don’t guarantee the outcome. If it is unfavourable, you should treat the report as internal lessons learnt rather than marketing collateral.
