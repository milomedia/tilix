  headline: Tilix Research FAQ
  text: |-
    * **How long does it take to execute a research project?** 2 months is the average duration but shorter or longer projects are quite common.
    * **How long are research reports?** It depends on the type of report, the subject chosen, as well as other factors. Tilix reports range from 5 page market overviews or appraisals to upwards of 60 pages for in-depth studies.
    * **Can I ask Tilix to validate our claims?** Absolutely. We are happy to act as an independent 3rd party to validate your company's claims about its products or services. However, we donâ€™t guarantee the outcome. If it is unfavourable, you should treat the report as internal lessons learnt rather than marketing collateral.
