    An Enterprise Health Check is the entry point in all new engagements. This four step work package can be applied to a single process (e.g. customer acquisition, meter exchange) or function (e.g. customer service, billing, IT). However, most impact is achieved when the whole enterprise is in scope.

    1. The initial goal is to observe through light-weight structured interviews and desk research.
    2. A more intense Diagnostic Assessment looks at the current strategic and tactical state.
    3. Business Architecture Advice and a Recommendations Report provides options to decide on.
    4. Follow up support frames how to act on the road to change.

    The lessons learnt from cases are numerous and wide ranging. Tilix understands that there is no one size fits all solution. We know when to use different tools and how to adapt to the different cycles:

    Start-up and accelerated growth is about initiating and managing a rapidly growing business. Assembling capabilities and optimising performance are the key points of focus.

    Sustaining success is about finding new ways to take a business to the next level and ensuring complacency does not take root.

    Realignment and Turnaround are cycles where the focus is returning a business to a sustainable state. Sometimes it is not obvious change is necessary. Sometimes there is an obvious crisis.
