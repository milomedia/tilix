  text: |
    For many organisations digital transformation is a no-brainer, but it can be pretty hard to do. Some of the barriers in the way include:
    - **Time:** Inefficient business processes take too much effort but digital replacements don't appear overnight.
    - **Cost:** High software costs and complex integrations with hidden technical debt.
    - **Quality:** Leveraging technology and automation whilst maintaining the trust and loyalty of all stakeholders including customers, operatives and managers.
    - **Scope:** Deciding which market insights to respond to in order to strengthen customer relationships, reduce costs and increase sales.

    Digital technology applied in smart ways is changing the game with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable a few years ago. The key benefits include:

    - **Efficiency:** Operations powered by digital technology create a competitive advantage through superior productivity, quality and agility.
    - **Innovation:** The fossil fuel end game will be a more radical upheaval than we have seen in retail, music, newspapers, and finance. Digital enterprises are in pole position to challenge current business models in the global energy system.
