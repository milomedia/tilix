    Innovation is a significant factor in economic growth and will enhance the competitiveness of any organisation. Tilix helps its clients by:

    * Providing guidance on fulfilling unmet customer needs
    * Increasing business opportunities and opening new markets
    * Reducing time to market
    * Saving cost and reducing risk when innovating and collaborating
    * Increasing the ability take reasonable risks and face challenges
    * Improving the efficiency and the performance of the innovation process
    * Increasing the return on investments made in innovation
    * Applying customs and practices appropriate to organisational maturity and market conditions

    The product lifecycle of products is getting shorter because of increased competition. This forces companies to reduce the time to market without sacrificing quality.

    To succeed understanding of both market and technical problems are needed. Tilix brings solutions to both dimensions through its marketing and engineering expertise.

    A frequent goal is to cultivate a suitable environment to encourage innovation and collaboration. The best results require confirmation within the organisation's strategy that innovation is a core competency. Senior management's support is crucial to successful innovation; clear direction, endorsement, and support are necessary but not sufficient for success.
