    Tilix helps its clients drive through the challenges that can hinder the progress of innovation by:

    - Reframing innovation by refreshing the strategy and how success is measured.
    - Motivating and empowering employees to be creative and to think out of the box.
    - Fostering collaboration by getting innovation out of silos (both internal and external).
    - Introducing external ideas and opinions (e.g. competitive analysis, voice of the customer). 
    - Solving the innovator’s dilemma when current product success is fostering complacency.
    - Increasing velocity to cope with ever shorter and shorter product life cycles.

    Being able to change and adapt is one of the most important factors for success and growth. Leveraging external expertise will assist in making innovation a core competency in every corner of an organisation. Tilix helps its clients profit from innovation in several  ways:

    Reducing cost and risk, for example by accelerating time to market. Increased sales come through fulfilling unmet customer needs and/or opening new markets. Improving the efficiency and performance of existing technology,  processes or organisation.

    > "The quality of the innovation support from Tilix was first class and superb value for money.” **Magnus Carlsson, Director of Corporate Development, Duni AB**
