  headline: Brokering Partnerships
  text: |-
    It is not surprising that **Key Partnerships** is the first section of the [Business Model Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas). There is no such thing as end to end or we can do it all.

    Tilix works as a partnership broker to help our clients push forwards their commercial success in the transition to smart and digital energy. We find the variety here particularly satisfying: every partnership has different commercial and technical nuances that have to be taken into account.

However, the firm offers experience from across the whole value chain.

    For example [Pivot Power](https://www.pivot-power.co.uk/) recently turned to Tilix for strategic and tactical advice on licensing spanning generation, distribution and supply.
