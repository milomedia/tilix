On 22 May, 10 innovative seed-stage cleantech start-ups presented at the Nordic Cleantech Open (NCO) finals in Stockholm with the event being moderated by [Andreas Stubelius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-stubelius-8643b319/) from the [Swedish Energy Agency](http://www.energimyndigheten.se/).

After an intense and very tight final in the spotlight, the final ranking of the 8th Edition of NCO was:

1. [SurfCleaner ](https://surfcleaner.com), which took first place with its unparalleled solution to eliminate and separate pollutants from water surfaces.
2. [Moving Floor](http://movingfloor.se), which provides automatic cleaning for livestock through a system of self-cleaning floors.
3. [Einride](https://www.einride.tech), with its transportation as a service solution based on all-electric, autonomous vehicles, or ”T-pods”.

Based on the critical criteria of innovation, market potential and team spirit, the NCO helps early-stage clean technology companies develop their businesses.

> It was a pleasure to hear the finalists pitch and to see the interest from investors and industry stakeholders. With my personal interests in mobility and AI, I was rooting for Einride. That said, all the finalists impressed me and made for a very enjoyable afternoon. [**Dr Neil Williams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drneilwilliams/)**, tilix.energy**
