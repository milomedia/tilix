EVEC, a Swedish automotive engineer specialising in electric vehicles chose Tilix to transform its digital business systems. The solution includes a new mobile friendly website coupled with Forestry CMS, Hubspot CRM and MailChimp campaign management.

> We chose Tilix because we want our customers (supercar OEM and EV enthusiasts) to have credible, useful and engaging digital experiences with EVEC. Not only will our new digital business systems showcase our work, it will enable the EVEC team to better manage customer relationships and increase marketing ROI.” - **Martin Söderlind, Founder of EVEC**


## The challenge
The firm has for some time had a website but this was no more than a glorified business card. EVECs customers include supercar OEMs and EV enthusiasts.

## Our solution
Tilix provides EVEC with a complete digital marketing system that provides strategy, tactics, content management, data driven customer insights, alerts on customer engagement and the ability to manage marketing activities.

A core element of the new digital marketing system is the intelligent prospecting mechanism, a proprietary process that forecasts the propensity for customers to engage with different messages and to provide EVEC with alerts on how best to respond to inbound leads.

## Desired Outcomes
- Increased credibility and findability of EVEC’s website.
- Reduced time spent on fatigue duties through automation.
- Expanded use of digital marketing channels to include mobile, email and social as well as web.
