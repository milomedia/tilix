Tilix has provided ad hoc support to Uniti for almost three years: contributing in a variety of areas such as liaising with government grant bodies, supporting crowdfunding efforts and coaching the technical team in topics such as R&D management, vehicle development and prototyping.

Building on this productive relationship, Uniti will now leverage Tilix's innovation management expertise to address specific R&D goals in its business plan. The areas of focus will be:

* managing sources of R&D funding;
* leading R&D activity;
* nurturing medium to long term partnerships;
* identifying and transitioning innovations for scaling up;
* extracting value from ideas that do not get backed for scale.

> Tilix innovation management service is an ideal solution for Uniti as we move into our next stage of growth. It will help our R&D function deliver material value to our company and our products. **Lewis Horne, Uniti CEO**

R&D’s mandate is to **position Uniti to catch the next wave**. With support from Tilix, Uniti's R&D function will undertake precious gold mining activity and will provide a key plank in Uniti’s mission to make a positive impact on the future of mobility.

> Uniti represents a wonderful opportunity for reshaping the city car. It is a blank canvas for creativity and innovation in autonomous, electric, connected and shared mobility. The Tilix team is delighted that Uniti has chosen us to help take its R&D to the next level. **Dr Neil Williams, Tilix CEO**

This R&D approach means that Uniti’s core team can stay focused on its short to medium-term goals of building a production line and getting cars onto the road. Therefore, Uniti can grow revenue whilst in tandem taking positions on the longer term opportunities offered by emerging innovations in mobility.

> Uniti will have a number of R&D projects cooking in parallel. Tilix will use a variety of innovation management and partnership brokering techniques to ensure that each has some potential to catch the next big wave. **Dr Neil Williams, Tilix CEO**
