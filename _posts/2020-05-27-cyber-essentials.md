Tilix is pleased to offer support to startups and SMEs that would like to obtain Cyber Essentials. This can be in the form of ad hoc advisory or as a turnkey solution.

## About Cyber Essentials

Cyber Essentials is a UK government-backed security assurance scheme that was developed to support the UK Government's National Cyber Security Strategy in improving the overall security posture of UK businesses and organisations on the Internet.

It is of particular relevance to small-to-medium sized enterprises (SME's) where IT is not a core competency. The IT systems in these firms are primarily made up of common-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, rather than heavily customised, complex solutions.

There are two levels to Cyber Essentials. There is the standard Cyber Essentials accreditation and then there is Cyber Essentials Plus.

Cyber Essentials certification process includes a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) and an external vulnerability scan. Defends against common attack vectors that target enterprise-level and corporate IT systems.

Cyber Essentials Plus brings the evaluation process one step further as it requires an audit from a qualified third-party assessor in addition to the self-assessment survey required for the standard Cyber Essentials certification.

Cyber Essentials certification costs for smaller companies can be less than £500 at basic level. For the CES Plus level,  cost are in the £2K ballpark.

## The Five Controls

Cyber Essentials covers five main technical controls which will protect companies against an estimated 80% of common internet threats (cyber attacks including hacking, phishing, password guessing, etc). The controls are:

1. **Boundary firewalls and internet gateways** - all networks should have a properly configured firewall.
2. **Secure configuration** - default configurations are often vulnerable; these need to be made secure.
3. **User access controls** - only the correct, authorised people can access systems.
4. **Malware protection** - protection against malware and other viruses.
5. **Patch management** - all software and systems should have the latest security patches installed.

## Cyber Essentials Support from Tilix

Tilix can support clients in performing a preliminary cyber audit covering the 5 key Cyber Essentials controls outlined above.

> Cyber Essentials provides SMEs a foundation on which they can build a security posture that can evolve to meet the increasing variety and complexity of cyber threats. **Dr Neil Williams, CxO, Tilix**

The starting point is an initial conversation. This is followed by a quick look at the current situation and an assessment of the available options. In many cases the support from Tilix is light-touch advisory and is free of charge. In some cases, where a more meticulous approach is required or client resources are simply not available to do the necessary self-certification work, additional support can be purchased from Tilix.
