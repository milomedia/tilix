The Duni brand name is sold in more than 40 markets and is the market leader in Central and Northern Europe. Duni has circa 2,300 employees in 23 countries, with headquarters in Malmö and production units in Sweden, Germany, Poland, Thailand and New Zealand. Duni is listed on NASDAQ Stockholm under the ticker name "DUNI".

Duni applies the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance, is FSC certified and is fully committed to Corporate Social Responsibility.

Duni has built a track record of success over several decades. It’s strong position has been achieved through a combination of high quality products, a well-reputed brand, established customer relations and strong local presence in most European markets.

Johan Sundelin assumed the role of CEO at Duni Q4 2017, replacing Thomas Gustafsson, who had five successful years at Duni.

Johan has extensive and substantial experience from fast moving consumer goods, and had previously held leading positions at Santa Maria (Paulig Group), Orkla and Unilever.

Under Johan’s direction, Duni is investing in medium-term initiatives to sustain success and adapt to a rapidly changing market.

## The challenge

Johan Sundelin’s appointment coincided with the start of [the most substantial transformation the paper and forest-products industry has seen in many decades](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/paper-forest-products-and-packaging/our-insights/pulp-paper-and-packaging-in-the-next-decade-transformational-change). Duni sees opportunity in these potentially existential challenges from technology, demographic changes and the environment.

Duni’s proactive response is evidenced by its [acquisition of Biopak](https://www.duni.com/en/investor-relations/pressreleases/press-releases-archive/2018/duni-acquires-shares-in-biopak-pty-ltd-the-leading-supplier-of-sustainable-packaging-in-australia-and-new-zealand/) and [appointment of Johan Mårtensson as Business & Innovation Manager](https://duni.inpublix.com/2018/en/duni-2018/we-deliver-sustainable-experiences/).

The challenges presented to Tilix were:

* Map out the next waves of innovation, in energy and the environment, at the paper mill.
* Increase synergies between Duni’s two innovation roadmaps: sourcing and acquiring.

## The solution

First, there was a process of orientation where a diagnostic assessment was made. This involved carrying out several structured interviews to elicit the current strategic and tactical state across the whole enterprise.

Specialist advice was delivered in two areas to directly address the challenges presented.

Initially, Tilix provided outline business cases for deploying environmental innovations in energy storage, carbon trading and water management at Duni's paper mill in Skåpafors, Sweden.

Finally, to increase synergies between Duni’s two innovation roadmaps Tilix introduced a portfolio management framework that improves optics across all dimensions of Duni’s incubation, transformation, performance and productivity zones.

## The results

In helping to sustain success at Duni, Tilix has introduced novel ideas in both evolutionary and disruptive innovation contexts. Tilix advice has been a catalyst for turning strategy into action.
