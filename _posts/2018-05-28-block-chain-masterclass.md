Investors (both corporate and private) will learn how to methodically and effectively surf these waves.

Hope or hype? The reality is not black or white. Jean-Jacques Jouanna will take a thorough look at the facts, opportunities and myths. There will be an executive briefing on the current state of the art plus lively discussion and debate.

### Human Factors
Andrew Hancock knows that people are the vital spark who drive innovation and then provide flexibility to make it work in practice.

## The Event Hosts
NovAzure and Tilix masterclasses focus on managing innovation within the smart and digital transformation of energy.

Renewables combined with smart, digital control of energy are leading us towards an energy future that is clean and secure. The wealth creation opportunities in this market are proven and continue to grow.

Industry 4.0 is coming down the pike at a speed our the energy sector can barely comprehend. We need to adapt our ways of thinking and working to reap the benefits of electrification of everything, blockchain, machine learning, bots, 3D printing and more.

NovAzure’s origins are in oil & gas, whereas for Tilix they are in electrical engineering. However, we share the same vision and passion smart and digital energy.

## Sponsorship
Tilix and NovAzure events attract industry professionals who are leading the smart and digital transformation of energy.

We are delighted to offer our sponsors access to senior decision-makers in an intimate environment. Unlike large conferences or summits, the audience of circa 50 people at our events are far more accessible.

The events are focussed and intense with carefully curated topics and speakers. Through collaboration, innovation and real industry insight we are able to design unique marketing experiences that positions our partners as visionaries.

Without competition there would be no need for strategy. Therefore, we invest a lot of time and energy in benchmarking our offer against those from Marketforce, Faversham House, Cornwall Insight etc. We believe there are many unique features in what we do. Also, as you would expect, we can tailor thought-leadership sessions, hospitality packages, display space and on-site event branding to fit our sponsor's needs.
