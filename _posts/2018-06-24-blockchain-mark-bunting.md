As an advisor and investor to several technology firms, I like to keep a close eye on emerging trends. I am acutely aware of the ongoing transformation in energy. In this category, I am actively involved with [Logicor](http://www.clear-heater.co.uk) (who offer electric heating as a service) and others.

In this guest post, I share my observations about the blockchain investment landscape and its potential as a competitive weapon in smart energy.

### Thoughts on Blockchain’s emergence
From [Blockchain Adoption in Capital Markets - 2018](https://www.greenwich.com/equities/blockchain-adoption-capital-markets-2018) by financial market intelligence firm [Greenwich Associates][48] I see that reduced operating costs is a primary benefit of distributed ledger technology in financial markets.

The total annual budget for enterprise blockchain initiatives across capital markets and banking are a staggering $1.7B. So it is clear that blockchain is fuelling change in the FinTech sector. Whilst many believe that the advancements taking place are going to be game changing, I have a more guarded perspective.

Some use cases for blockchain in banking and other financial institutions map to the energy sector e.g. renewables project financing and commodity trading. However, its role in networks, retail and energy efficiency is more nuanced.

### Key Value Propositions
Blockchain's most important feature is [immutability](https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/02/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-immutability-of-blockchains/). It is important to note that immutability does not mean that the data can’t be changed. Rather it is very difficult to change without collusion it is easy to detect attempt.

This is particularly valuable in applications it’s critical that transactions are part of a permanent record. The example I hear most talked about is peer to peer energy trading.

### Evaluating investment opportunities in the energy sector
People is one of the biggest factors. In particular I look at the quality of the leadership team and the partners behind the project. Staying power is important. I need to feel confident that they will survive the lean times on the roller coaster ride towards finding a product-market fit.

### Raising the Likelihood of Startup Success
For me, the key metric is cash and the top priority for a startup CEO is not to run out of cash. Entrepreneurs and inventors often struggle with cash flow management and finding sources of investment. Thats where advisors like me can help.

### How to Navigate the Competitive Landscape
Having first mover advantage is helpful but is neither necessary nor sufficient. Assuming cash is not a problem and there is a product-market fit, the key question is can they achieve enough momentum to reach escape velocity?

### Ones to Watch
I am particularly intrigued by [Electron](http://www.electron.org.uk) and am delighted that they will be at the NovAzure and Tilix Masterclass.

I am keeping a close eye on [R3](https://www.r3.com), waiting to see when they may be ready to engage properly with the energy sector.

The [Zero Carbon Project][ZCP1] is another with exciting prospects. They are tackling climate change using blockchain and recently [won two blockchain awards in London and Amsterdam][ZCP2]. [Zero Carbon Project is currently in the democratic private pre-sale round][ZCP3].

### Final Thoughts
I believe blockchain will touch every element of the energy value chain in one way or another. The rationale is simple: the sector is moving from a static, linear structure of large generators -> monopoly networks -> disengaged consumer to a complex web of distributed, smart and clean system including a large number of engaged prosumers.

For many blockchain is a space for prospectors. For example, traditional investors with their rational thinking would not invest in Ethereum a couple of years ago. It now has an eye-watering market cap! I see that blockchain is crossing the chasm from the world of prospectors to that of the investor. I am doing my homework and getting ready to make investments in the next year or two.
