Experts from the industry highlighted the latest technologies and discussed how the e-mobility sector is rapidly becoming more interconnected and autonomous.

> The seminar covered the key viewpoints in mobility and helped me expand my mind map on the topic. I am sure it will lead to actions and decisions for stakeholders across the Skåne region. For some this could be updates to risk registers and mitigation plans. For others it will be creating or refining vision or strategy  **_Neil Williams, tilix.energy_**
