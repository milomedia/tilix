Tilix enjoy talking about a wide range of topics across the whole energy value chain. We regularly deliver keynotes and join panels at energy industry events.

> The eMobility Summit will discuss the key challenges people have with electric vehicle and to present the latest trends in connectivity, autonomy and sharing. We are of course delighted to have Tilix and their client Uniti EV as speakers.  **Adrian Said, Event Director, eMobility Summit.**

## Our Specialisms
Tilix talks with authority about challenges and opportunities in the energy industry. For example we've been invited to speak about:

 - the practicalities of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)
 - the long term impact of Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and electric mobility.

> The first thing I did this morning was to sing the praises of yesterday’s GDPR seminar. The speakers were articulate and clear and for what could have been a very dry event, it was timed to perfection and my objectives for the day were met. **Civil Servant**.  

> It was a very informative event and I have taken a lot out of it. I have been to three GDPR events and yours was definitely the most informative and practical. **Energy Retailer**

> Tilix speakers have introduced inspiring new ideas and opinions to Wheatley. This has been a great help in clarifying our approach to the digital transformation of the energy industry. **Jeremey Goulding, CEO, Wheatley Solutions**
