This post provides a summary of what I've learned about managing the creative writing process whilst writing for the Tilix Blog and working on the development of several digital properties in the GB energy supply market. The topics covered are:

- The Publishing Workflow
- Content Maps
- The Editorial Calendar

The key lesson I have found is that process and procedure does not stifle the creative process. In fact being organised helps produce quality content. This is somewhat like how the brakes on a car can help make driving at fast speed safe and comfortable.

## Publishing Workflow
Regardless of the type of content, Tilix uses a four stage workflow. This seems to work well for project managing most content creation jobs.

1. **Initiate**: capture the essence of the piece in a brief.
2. **Elaborate**: Estimate of time/effort required together with a list of reference material & people to interview in relation to the topic.
3. **Create**: Do fact finding and interviews. Write drafts and get feedback from trusted colleagues.
4. **Publish**: Turn the raw words into a form ready for publication and complete a final review.

For larger teams each stage may follow a strict step by step process because input from a broader range of stakeholders (e.g. legal, PR, graphics) is required. However, for a small team the approach can be more fluid.

Regardless of whether the process is lightweight or heavyweight, content always moves forwards in an iterative and incremental manner. An agile, adaptive approach is necessary because there are invariably a number of obstacles and challenges to overcome before the content is ready to be published.

## The Content Map
Content mapping is a visual technique that will helps organise the content of a website. It is a valuable part of a siteâ€™s overall content strategy. The most basic content map is a bullet list. More sophisticated examples are highly stylised mind maps or grid layouts. Content maps help in the exploration and visualisation of the content of a whole site.

### An Energy Suppliers Foundational Content
Tilix has worked with a number of challenger suppliers in the GB Market advising them on their licence obligations and digital engineering imperatives. From this experience, we can see that the foundational content for most suppliers fits into the following basic map:

- FAQs
- Meters
- Careers
- Emergency
- Our Tariffs
- Complaints
- Consumer Advice
- T&Cs
    - Your Contract
    - Cookies Policy
    - Privacy Policy

Tilix maintains a library of templates and style guidelines for the above content. The firm also tracks how a number of different suppliers treat each piece. I find it interesting to see the repeating patterns and diversity within the market.

Each item has its own particular facets. For example, complaints is a regulated process and will require much more rigour to produce than say the content for the careers page. The content creation process must provide a level of flexibility. We have found that the Tilix approach can consistently produce the right result, on time and to budget.

## The Editorial Calendar
It's normally the case that content is produced in batches or series. Here the editorial calendar plays a vital role in managing the creative process.

Editorial calendars have been used within the print industry for centuries to manage the publication of books, magazines, and newspapers. Internet publishers use them to organise content and ensure it is published at regular intervals.

It is possible to use a paper calendar, a spreadsheet, or software integrated with desktop publishing software. Whatever approach, it usually tracks story ideas and the production calendar as well as recording the history of published content.

### Hello Trello
Tilix uses Trello to manage content creation for our own blog and client projects. Thereby each member of the team has access to notes, documents and the schedule as well as a powerful communication channel with colleagues. This tool is particularly valuable in controlling progress of each piece on the editorial calendar and provides a convenient way of maintaining a holistic perspective.

Tilix chose Trello due to its cards and lists where information can be both stored and shared in a way that is accessible and informative to other members of a publication team. A Trello board has many different functions, including checklists, labels to colour coordinate each piece of information, due dates, attachments for documents linked to each  card, and a members list, where each member of the team can see who is responsible for each card. Within Tilix, we use the Trello Example Board to queue potential article pieces and process their development to completion from the initial conception of the idea for an article or piece of content to its  publication. Tilix separate their lists on Trello into five different categories:

1. **Info & Reference**: Within this list, our cards all feature a description of the process of our inception of each content piece.

2. **Backlog**: This list features cards that represent each piece of content that need to be written in the future, hence why it is in our backlog to be discussed at a later point and to continue a stream of continuous, regular publications.

3. **Queued**: These are the pieces of content that are up next, ones that have been assigned to a member of the team and are waiting to be started, with a due date already set.

4. **Work In Progress**: Naturally, this list features all of the content pieces on individual cards that have been started and are currently being written. Tilix also include a five-step workflow tick-box section within each card so it is clear to see how far each content piece is until completion.

5. **Recently Done**: Here, all of the content is complete and has either been published or is ready to be published. Having this list on the Trello Board allows us to assess our progress, and get a general understanding of how often we have published and hit our due dates.

### ACME Energy
The screen shot above shows a shot of the editorial calendar for the fictional supply business ACME Energy. [Get a hi-res version here](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Acme-Editorial-Trello.png). Here you can see how which content is in the backlog, what is queued and what is work in progress. The final column shows that the Editorial calendar has been recently done.

I look forward to publishing a series of blog posts which deep dive into several of the content items listed above. I'll look at what's common and what's different across the market. In many cases I will present examples of original content for ACME Energy to highlight the impact of tone of voice and writing style.
