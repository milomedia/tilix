## The Opportunity

In an electric grid, ancillary services are speciality services and functions (going beyond generation and transmission) that facilitate and support the continuous flow of electricity so that supply will continually meet demand. Thanks to deregulation and technological advances, a market has blossomed for independent service providers that deliver frequency control, spinning reserves and operating reserves.

The ongoing growth of renewable generation and the development of smart grid technologies are prompting a shift in the ancillary services market and creating opportunities for entrepreneurs.

At the same time, there will be a 40% increase in UK electricity demand by 2030. To meet net zero carbon targets massive structural change is needed. Renewable energy generation will be increasingly important.

Resilience Energy is playing a part in this transformation by helping to turn homes, businesses and communities into power stations which deliver net zero energy bills and carbon-free buildings by combining solar panels and batteries with “microgrid flex services” which match local generation and consumption to suit the wider needs of national electricity systems.

## The Challenge

Widespread adoption of batteries, EVs, heat pumps, etc. – coupled with proprietary software – will empower Resilience Energy to enable and monetise the flexibility of assets in ways which incumbents cannot.

The incumbents, which are known as “aggregators”, have the luxury of large industrial customers. They also have high expectations of yearly sales. Resilience Energy is addressing a niche away from the incumbent customer and has more time to focus and innovate on this smaller venture.

By the time the new market segment becomes interesting to the incumbent aggregators, it will be too late for them to react and keep up with Resilience Energy’s rate of improvement.

In 2020, Resilience Energy has gone to market with two value propositions:

1. **READY**: A software-as-a-service platform which turns household, community and small business energy systems into virtual power plants.
2. **PROJECTS**: Turnkey virtual power plants including design, installation and ongoing operation and maintenance services through the software-as-a-service platform.

## Tilix Approach

Flexibility to adjust to the emerging needs of a fast-moving startup is key to the Tilix approach to its engagement with Resilience Energy. Having informally advised the founder over the past couple of years, Tilix has started the assignment with a solid understanding of stakeholder needs throughout the whole enterprise. The firm is perfectly placed to:

1. provide an external meta-perspective to inform the short, mid and long-term direction of the company;
2. interact with current and potential future investors and facilitate introductions and meetings;
3. bring deals into the business development pipeline.

Most importantly, thanks to its depth of experience in data science, Tilix has what it takes to get Resilience Energy’s numerical models to the next level. In this area, mission critical advice and software will be delivered with the care, skill and ability expected of experts in this field.
